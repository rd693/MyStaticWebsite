<p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word &#8220;and&#8221; and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.</p>

<p>Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there&#8217;s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!</p>



<p>&#8221; He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn&#8217;t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. &#8220;Getting up early all the time&#8221;, he thought, &#8220;it makes you stupid. You&#8217;ve got to get enough sleep.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn&#8217;t have to look at the floundering legs, and </p><cite>only stopped</cite></blockquote>



<p>Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I&#8217;d get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn&#8217;t have my parents to think about I&#8217;d have given in my notice a long time ago, I&#8217;d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He&#8217;d fall right off his desk!</p>

<p>A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table &#8211; Samsa was a travelling salesman &#8211; and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.</p>



<p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word &#8220;and&#8221; and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. </p>



<p>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again.</p>



<ol><li>Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex!</li><li>Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz.</li><li>Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox.</li><li>Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.</li><li>Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim.</li></ol>



<p>And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Our way of living should be better than you think. It&#8217;s more realistic than dreaming.</p></blockquote>



<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.</p>

<p>If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is. The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.</p>

<p>Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.

The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental.
